* dispersal model

This pyshon code attempts to replicate the model used in:

Modelling single nucleotide effects in /phosphoglucose isomerase/ on dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly: coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. 2009. Chaozhi Zheng, Otso Ovaskainen and Ilkka Hanski. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. doi: https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0005

The simulation code utilises a priority (heap) queue for storing individual entities and always picking the one which is about to act next.

The code is in two parts:

** landscape.py

todo

** simulation.py
