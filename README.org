* dispersal model
  
This python code attempts to replicate the model used in:

Modelling single nucleotide effects in /phosphoglucose isomerase/ on dispersal in the Glanville fritillary butterfly: coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. 2009. Chaozhi Zheng, Otso Ovaskainen and Ilkka Hanski. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2009.0005

Modelling dispersal with diffusion and habitat selection: Analytical results for highly fragmented landscapes. 2009. Chaozhi Zheng, Juho Pennanen and Otso Ovaskainen. Ecological Modelling. doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.02.024

The simulation code utilises a priority (heap) queue for storing individual entities and always picking the one which is about to act next.

The code is in two parts:

** ~landscape.py~

usage: ~python3 landscape.py -i test-par.json -o test-ls.json~

** ~simulation.py~

usage: ~python3 simulation.py -p test-par.json -d test-ls.json -s 1~
